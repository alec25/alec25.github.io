# Welcome to my website 

To learn more about me, please visit my **[About Me](./about) page**. 

To play my **Flappy Bird game** (still in progress) click [here](flappy). To view its repository on GitHub, click [here](https://github.com/alecthekulak/flappy). The goal is to design a Flappy Bird game (entierly from scratch, including the sprites) that works in a web browser (using the [p5.js project](https://p5js.org/)) and then to establish a machine-learning system to beat the game. Inspiration is drawn from [Srdjan Susnic](https://www.youtube.com/user/ssusnic) and [Code Bullet](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0e3QhIYukixgh5VVpKHH9Q) on YouTube. Should end up similar to a OpenAI Gym (they redid their website recently and there's no longer any profile pages, so I unfortunately can't link the performance of the models that I developed).
